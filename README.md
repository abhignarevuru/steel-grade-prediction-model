# Building a prediction model for matching steel grades

Aim: Matching steel sample composition to passing compositions of steel grades

This project aims to explore the possibility of using an ML prediction model to find the closest steel grade match on passing compositions to a given customer's requirements.

Code runs on R.
'Passing Compositions' data file is necessary for the code to run.
